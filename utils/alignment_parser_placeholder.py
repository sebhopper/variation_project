"""
This file serves as a placeholder for the alignment parsing module.

The actual implementation of the alignment parser is not publicly available
due to restrictions and the sensitive nature of the data it processes.
As such, this placeholder ensures compatibility and reference within the codebase
without exposing the underlying logic.

Developers integrating or modifying this project should implement their own
alignment parser or enquire for access to the original module if appropriate.
